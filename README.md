## 📋 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student data from Saudi schools abroad for the year 2025, with the aim of extracting valuable insights about the distribution of Saudi and non-Saudi students across different educational stages in eight countries. The analysis helps in making strategic decisions to develop the external educational system.

## 📊 Data Used
The data includes statistics on:
- Number of Saudi and non-Saudi students in each school
- Distribution of students by educational stages (kindergarten, primary, intermediate, secondary)
- Total number of students in each school

## 🔍 Key Findings
- The Saudi school in Djibouti has the largest number of non-Saudi students (688 students)
- The Saudi school in Kuala Lumpur has the largest number of Saudi students (340 students)
- There is a significant variation in the ratio of Saudi to non-Saudi students across different schools
- The primary stage constitutes the largest percentage of the total number of students in most schools

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive analytical dashboards
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis
  - Pandas: For data processing and cleaning
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations
  - NumPy: For advanced computational operations
